  > [!NOTE]
  > The commands above take the app env files from the [mobile-app-secrets](https://github.com/ice-blockchain/mobile-app-secrets) folder that should be downloaded beforehand and placed on the same level as the mobile-app project

- Run the App
  ```
  yarn run:android
  ## or
  yarn run:ios
  ```

## Localization rules

Weâ€™re keeping translations in `src/translations/locales/**.json`.
The translation types are generated with `yarn generate-translation-types` script (should be applied after any locale modification).
The types are generated based on `en.json` - that is the main locale and the fallback for other locales.
